I architected and built a content management system (CMS) in React and the mobile apps in React Native. The server architecture of the mobile app was also built on AWS. Using Lambda, Cognito, AppSync, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudFront, Kevin built a highly scalable, serverless architecture to handle the application load. This effort was hugely successful as C3 quickly scaled the system to support approximately 40 apps with 900,000 active users.",
